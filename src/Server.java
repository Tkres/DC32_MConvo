The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability, that is whether it can be proven to correspond to experience.\nAs a general concept experience comprises knowledge of or skill of some thing or some event gained through involvement in or exposure to that thing or event.\nA concept is a general idea, or something conceived in the mind.\nAn idea is a concept or mental impression. Very often, ideas are construed as representational images; i.e. images of some object. \nA mental representation, in philosophy of mind, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science, is a hypothetical internal cognitive symbol that represents external reality, or else a mental process that makes use of such a symbol; a formal system for making explicit certain entities or types of information, together with a specification of how the system does this.\nPhilosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind, mental events, mental functions, mental properties, consciousness and their relationship to the physical body, particularly the brain. \nPhilosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with reality, existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.\nA problem is an obstacle, impediment, difficulty or challenge, or any situation that invites resolution; the resolution of which is recognized as a solution or contribution toward a known purpose or goal.\nIntention is an agent's specific purpose in performing an action or series of actions, the end or goal that is aimed at. \nIn philosophy and sociology, agency is the capacity of an agent to act in a world.\nPhilosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with reality, existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.";
